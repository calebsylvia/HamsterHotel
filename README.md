# Replicate a website based off the XD prototype that was given to us and making it responsive for all devices
# Peer Review: Michael Heckerman
# Comments: Code looked clean. The site looked like the mock up. Site was responsive except for the nav bar once you got to tablet size or smaller the links vanish. I have no comment on how to fix that as I myself have that issue. Other then the nav bar issue the site looks good.
